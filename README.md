# Election Vote Sorting using Cocktail Shaker Sort

This project demonstrates the use of the Cocktail Shaker Sort algorithm to sort election votes in descending order. It includes three files:

1. `main.c`: Contains the `main` function to demonstrate the sorting of an array of integers.
2. `cocktail_sort.c`: Contains the implementation of the Cocktail Shaker Sort algorithm.
3. `election.c`: Uses the `cocktail_sort` function to sort an array of election votes.

## Usage

To compile and run the program:

```bash
gcc main.c cocktail_sort.c -o election
./election
